Problem statement:
We have CSV files coming in Azure Blob, need to process the files using spark as soon as arrives in.

Ans - 
There are multiple architectural approaches to achieve this.


1) using Blob trigger function
@app.blob_trigger(arg_name="myblob", path="sqltoblob/{name}", connection="AzureWebJobsStorage")


2) Event Grid -> Azure Function
-- requires more set up
-- create an event suscription
-- configure event grid
-- attach logic - either logic apps or Azure function


3) Event Grid -> Event Hub -> Databricks



Criteria                           | Blob Trigger Function                           | Event Grid → Azure Function                      | Event Grid → Event Hub → Databricks
-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------
Overview                           | Function directly triggered on blob upload      | Event Grid pushes notification to Function       | Event Grid sends event to Event Hub → Databricks
Setup Complexity                   | ⭐ Simple                                       | 🔧 Moderate (Event Grid + Function setup)        | 🛠️ Complex (3 services: Grid, Hub, Databricks)
Latency                            | ⏱️ Low (~1-2 sec, may vary)                     | ⏱️ Very Low (~sub-second)                        | ⏱️ Medium (~1–5 sec)
Scalability                        | ⚠️ Limited (due to polling and cold start)      | ✅ High (Event Grid is scalable)                 | ✅ High (Event Hub + Databricks can scale well)
Reliability                        | ⚠️ Lower (polling-based, possible misses)       | ✅ High (Event Grid retries, durable events)     | ✅ Very High (streaming, replay, checkpointing)
Best Use Case                      | Simple blob-to-function file processing         | Realtime, reliable event-driven logic             | High-throughput blob data pipeline into Spark
Cost Implication                   | 💰 Very low (Function only)                     | 💰 Low (Function + minimal Event Grid)           | 💰 Medium (Event Hub + Databricks compute)
Flexibility                        | ❌ Low (tied to blob SDK trigger config)        | ✅ Medium (routing & filtering possible)         | ✅ High (streaming, batching, routing logic)
Custom Logic Support               | ✅ Yes (in Function code)                       | ✅ Yes (in Function code)                        | ✅ Yes (inside Databricks notebooks/jobs)
Native Databricks Integration      | ❌ No direct integration                        | ❌ No direct integration                         | ✅ Yes (via Auto Loader, structured streaming)
Limitations                        | May miss events; no filter; polling based       | Needs Event Grid setup, not direct execution     | High setup and DevOps overhead; more services
